# my-investment-preformace-
I was tired of manually updating my dividend charts, so I automated it :)

Hello welcome to my ted talk :)

--- Whats this app for?
	I love getting dividend! i love seeing the bargraphs grow on my preformance tracker 
but it gets reppetative to spend 15+ minutes scrolling looking for a symbol and adding the amount
off the brokradge account. So why not get it done instantaniously? Well that's the idea behind the
app, i want to see the preformance of div without having to work for it!
If you're a long term invester youll simpathise with. 
 
--- How do i use the app?
	Great question! load the app into a folder that's easy to access from the comand prompt
in the folder youll want to load the data from your brokradge. Next, execute ' python invest.py [name of csv with data].csv year '.
The app will handle the rest!

--- What pip installs do i need?
	Well obviously python, https://www.python.org/downloads/ and
	matplotlib:  ' python -m pip install -U matplotlib '. 

	
	I hope it brings you value and happiness throught the minutes saved by not manually inputting the data :)
